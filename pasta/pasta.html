        <h2>About Fusuli Pasta</h2>
        <p>A simple and personal favorite dish, fusuli pasta should be a <strong>staple</strong>in most peoples meal plans. With a suprising amount of protein, this dish is healthy for you and will do a good job in restoring your energy for people with active lifestyles. The versatile nature of this dish means that you can customise the dish with whatever toppings you may wish to do so. I personally like to use cheese and butter in my pasta...</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A bag of fusuli pasta</li>
            <li>100g of cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>20g of butter</li>
            <li>Boiling hot water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the kettle to however much your pan needs to submerge the pasta fully.</li>
            <li>While the kettle boils, get a bowl and pour in the amount of pasta you desire and get the cheese and butter at your disposal.</li>
            <li>Pour the pasta into the pan and, once boiled, pour the kettle in the pan until the pasta is submerged.</li>
            <li>Set a timer for 10 minutes and make sure to stir the pan every 2 minutes until you have reached 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Grate the cheese and spread bits of butter around the bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is boiled, put the pasta in a siv and let the water soak out of the siv. To speed up the process, shake the siv.</li>
            <li>Pour the pasta into the bowl and place the cheese on top of the pasta.</li>
        </ol>
